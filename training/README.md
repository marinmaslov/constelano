# 🤖 HAAR training branch

🎯 *Training target:* Lyra Constellation
📝 *Target description:* Lyra consists of 6 bigger stars and multiple other smaller stars. The cascade will be trained to recognize those 6 brightest stars.
📋 *Training overall description:* A few training attempt will be made in hope that a `cascade.xml` will be generated that will be able to recognize the marked pattern of Lyra. Each training attempt will be described, it's training parameters will be listed, and finally the results will be shown (and later compared altogether). If the results of no attempt will be able to recognize the constellation, another set of training attempts will be made on a set of data where the stars are not just marked, but also connected.
